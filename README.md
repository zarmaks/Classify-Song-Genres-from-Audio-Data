This project aims to classify songs into 'Hip-Hop' or 'Rock' genres based solely on their audio features, without listening to them. It involves preparing, exploring, and visualizing music data, followed by applying machine learning algorithms for classification.

**Data and Approach:**


**Data:** The dataset comprises track metadata and audio features like 'danceability' and 'acousticness', sourced from The Echo Nest (Spotify).
Approach: The project includes data cleaning, exploratory data visualization, feature reduction, and the implementation of machine learning algorithms such as decision trees and logistic regression.

**Technologies Used:**
Python
Pandas for data manipulation
Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualization
Scikit-learn for machine learning models

**Key Insights:**
The project reveals insights into the distinguishing features of the 'Hip-Hop' and 'Rock' genres.
Demonstrates the effectiveness of feature reduction in enhancing model performance.

**Acknowledgments:**
This project is a guided project from DataCamp, designed to apply practical data science skills in an engaging context.
